# Available Quality Rules

This version of the plugin provides ***62 quality rules*** and [***25 metrics***](METRICS.md). Note that not all of the rules will be available by default. Some rules are disabled - as they may not be applicable to all installations - and some are templates. These must be instantiated as required and configuration parameters provided.

| Name | Type | Has Parameters | Initial  State | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| [`AtLeastOneStarter`](AtLeastOneStarter.md) | Project | No | Enabled | Check that an application module should have one starter additional to the Activator process |
| [`BWVersionCheck`](BWVersionCheck.md) | Project | No | Enabled | Check if this BusinessWorks™ Module matches recommended version which has better performance and less vulnerabilities |
| [`BindingShouldHavePolicyAssociated`](BindingShouldHavePolicyAssociated.md) | Project | No | Enabled | To ensure that the communications are authentified all input connections should check that the binding has a policy associated |
| [`BindingShouldNotHaveHTTPBasicPolicyAssociated`](BindingShouldNotHaveHTTPBasicPolicyAssociated.md) | Project | No | Enabled | To ensure that the communications are authentified all input connections should check that the binding has a policy associated that is secure |
| [`BwSharedResourceUsingModuleProperty`](BwSharedResourceUsingModuleProperty.md) | Resource | No | Enabled | Parameter Resource using Module Property |
| [`CheckpointProcessHTTP`](CheckpointProcessHTTP.md) | Process | No | Enabled | This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. When placing your checkpoint in a process, be careful with certain types of process starters or incoming events, so that a recovered process instance does not attempt to access resources that no longer exist. For example, consider a process with an HTTP process starter that takes a checkpoint after receiving a request but before sending a response. In this case, when the engine restarts after a crash, the recovered process instance cannot respond to the request since the HTTP socket is already closed. As a best practice, do not place Checkpoint activity right after or in parallel path to HTTP activities. |
| [`CheckpointProcessJDBC`](CheckpointProcessJDBC.md) | Process | No | Enabled | This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. Do not place checkpoint after or in a parallel flow of Query activities or idempotent activities. Database operations such as Update, Insert and Delete are considered non-idempotent operations. You should always place a checkpoint immediately after any database insert or update activity to persist the response. However, for queries, there is no need to place checkpoints. |
| [`CheckpointProcessREST`](CheckpointProcessREST.md) | Process | No | Enabled | This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. When placing your checkpoint in a process, be careful with certain types of process starters or incoming events, so that a recovered process instance does not attempt to access resources that no longer exist. For example, consider a process with an HTTP process starter that takes a checkpoint after receiving a request but before sending a response. In this case, when the engine restarts after a crash, the recovered process instance cannot respond to the request since the HTTP socket is already closed. As a best practice, do not place Checkpoint activity right after or in parallel path to HTTP activities. |
| [`CheckpointProcessTransaction`](CheckpointProcessTransaction.md) | Process | No | Enabled | This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. Do not place checkpoint within or in parallel to a Transaction Group or a Critical Section Group. Checkpoint activities should be placed at points that are guaranteed to be reached before or after the transaction group is reached. |
| [`ChoiceWithNoOtherwise`](ChoiceWithNoOtherwise.md) | Process | No | Enabled | This rule checks all activities input mapping for choice statement. As a coding best practice, the choice statement should always include the option otherwise. |
| [`CriticalSection`](CriticalSection.md) | Process | No | Enabled | Critical section groups cause multiple concurrently running process instances to wait for one process instance to execute the activities in the group. As a result, there may be performance implications when using these groups. This rules checks that the Critical Section group does not include any activities that wait for incoming events or have long durations, such as Request/Reply activities, Wait For (Signal-In) activities, Sleep activity, or other activities that require a long time to execute. |
| [`DeadlockDetection`](DeadlockDetection.md) | Process | No | Enabled | There are many situations in which deadlocks can be created between communicating web services. This rule checks for deadlocks and infinite loops in BW6 process design. |

| [`ForEachMapping`](ForEachMapping.md) | Process | No | Enabled | This rule checks the Input mappings of activities. In activity Input mapping for performance reasons, it is recommended ato use Copy-Of instead of For-Each whenever possible. |
| [`GetFragmentBinary`](GetFragmentBinary.md) | Process | No | Enabled | GetFragment should use binary mode for performance assestment |

| [`ListFileActivityToCheckFileExistence`](ListFileActivityToCheckFileExistence.md) | Process | No | Enabled | Using List File activity to check if a single file exists is less performant than using ReadFile without fileContent check |
