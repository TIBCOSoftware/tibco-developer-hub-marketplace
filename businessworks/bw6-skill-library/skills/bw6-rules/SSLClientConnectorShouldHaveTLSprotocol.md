# SSLClientConnectorShouldHaveTLSprotocol

## What condition does this detect?

SSLClient Connector should use recommended TLS protocol to secure all communications between a client and a server

This is an ***Resource*** rule - the rule will test each resource of the application

## Why is this condition important?

Nowadays is not only important to create code that works but also code that is secure. Because of that is mandatory to provide some kind of confidentiality technique to be able to not allow anyone from the outside to call our service and generate a security breach. That's why we should use SSL as part of our HTTP communications but also we should use the SSL version that are considered secure at this point in time

## How to fix it?

Upgrade the level of SSL used to the considered secure today (TLS 1.0 or higher)

## How do I use this rule?

The rule is **_enabled_** by default. To disable it if unwanted, clone the default "**`BW6 Quality Profile`**" quality profile and then disable the rule.
